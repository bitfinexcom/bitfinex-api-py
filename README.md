# Bitfinex Trading API for Python. Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin trading
This is an official python library that is used to connect interact with the Bitfinex api. Currently, it only has support for websockets but will soon have Rest functionality as well.

## Installation

Clone package:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bitfinex-api-py.git
cd bitfinex-api-py
```
Install dependencies:
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Install package:
```sh
python3 setup.py install
```
Run the trades/candles example:
```sh
cd bfxapi/examples/ws
python3 subscribe_trades_candles.py
```

# Features
- Wbsocket support with multiplexing
- Real-time Trade, Orderbook, Account data feeds and more
- Authenticate with api key/secret
- Data checksum verifications
- Create, update and close orders
- Wallet withdraws/transfers

# Quickstart

### Authenticate

```python
bfx = Client(
  API_KEY='<YOUR_API_KEY>'
  API_SECRET='<YOUR_API_SECRET>'
)

@bfx.ws.on('authenticated')
async def do_something():
  print ("Success!")

bfx.ws.run()
```

### Submit limit order

```python
from bfxapi import Order
await bfx.ws.submit_order('tBTCUSD', 100, 0.01, Order.Type.EXCHANGE_MARKET)
```

### Listen for completion
```python
@bfx.ws.on('order_confirmed')
async def order_completed(order, trade):
  print ("Order has been confrmed")
```

### Get wallets
```python
wallets = bfxapi.ws.wallets.get_wallets()
# [ Wallet <'exchange_BTC' balance='41.25809589' unsettled='0'>,
#   Wallet <'exchange_USD' balance='62761.86070104' unsettled='0'> ]
```

### Order manipulation
All order function support onConfirm and onClose async callbacks. onConfirm is fired when we receive a signal from the websocket that the order has been confirmed. onClose is fired when we receive a signal that the order has either been filled or canceled.

```python

async def on_confirm(order):
  await bfx.ws.update_order(order.id, price=1000)

await bfx.ws.submit_order('tBTCUSD', 800, 0.1, onConfirm=on_confirm)
```

### Close all orders
```python
await bfx.ws.close_all_orders()
```


## `bfxapi.ws` events
The websocket exposes a collection of events that are triggered when certain data is received. When subscribing to an event you are able to pass either a standard function or an asyncio co-routine Here is a full list of available events:

- `all` (array|json): Listen for all messages coming through
- `connected:` () Called when a connection is made
- `disconnected`: () Called when a connection is ended (A reconnect attempt may follow)
- `stopped`: () Called when max amount of connection retries is met and the socket is closed
- `authenticated` (): Called when the websocket passes authentication
- `notification` (Notification): Incoming account notification
- `error` (array): Error from the websocket
- `order_closed` (Order, Trade): When an order has been closed
- `order_new` (Order, Trade): When an order has been created but not closed. Note: will not be called if order is executed and filled instantly
- `order_confirmed` (Order, Trade): When an order has been submitted and received
- `wallet_snapshot` (array[Wallet]): Initial wallet balances (Fired once)
- `order_snapshot` (array[Order]): Initial open orders (Fired once)
- `positions_snapshot` (array): Initial open positions (Fired once)
- `wallet_update` (Wallet): Changes to the balance of wallets
- `status_update` (json): New platform status info
- `seed_candle` (json): Initial past candle to prime strategy
- `seed_trade` (json): Initial past trade to prime strategy
- `funding_offer_snapshot` (array): Opening funding offer balances
- `funding_loan_snapshot` (array): Opening funding loan balances
- `funding_credit_snapshot` (array): Opening funding credit balances
- `balance_update` (array): When the state of a balance is changed
- `new_trade` (array): A new trade on the market has been executed
- `trade_update` (array): A trade on the market has been updated
- `new_candle` (array): A new candle has been produced
- `margin_info_updates` (array): New margin information has been broadcasted
- `funding_info_updates` (array): New funding information has been broadcasted
- `order_book_snapshot` (array): Initial snapshot of the order book on connection
- `order_book_update` (array): A new order has been placed into the ordebrook
- `subscribed` (Subscription): A new channel has been subscribed to
- `unsubscribed` (Subscription): A channel has been un-subscribed




# bfxapi ws interface

#### `on(event, function)`

  Subscribe a given function to be called when an event fires

#### `once(event, function)`

  Subscribes the function to the given event but only triggers once.

#### `subscribe(channel_name, symbol, timeframe=None, **kwargs)`
    
  Subscribes the socket to a data feed such as 'trades' or 'candles'.

#### `unsubscribe(chanId, onComplete=None)`
    
  Unsubscribes from the given data feed

#### `resubscribe(chanId, onComplete=None)`
  
  Unsubscribes and then subscribes to the given data feed. Usually used to trigger a snapshot response from the API.

#### `unsubscribe_all()`
    
  Unsubscribe from all data feeds.

#### `resubscribe_all(chanId, onComplete=None)`
    
  Unsubscribe and subscribe to all data feeds

#### `submit_order(symbol, price, amount, market_type, hidden=False, onConfirm=None, onClose=None, *args, **kwargs)`
  
  Submits an order to the Bitfinex api. When it has been verified that bitfinex has received the order then the `onConfirm` callback will be called followed by the `order_confirmed` event. Once it has been verified that the order has completely closed due to either being filled or canceled then the `onClose` function will be called, followed by the `order_closed` event.

#### `update_order(orderId, price=None, amount=None, delta=None, price_aux_limit=None, price_trailing=None, flags=None, time_in_force=None, onConfirm=None, onClose=None)`
  
  Attempts to update an order with the given values. If the order is no longer open then the update will be ignored.

#### `close_order(self, orderId, onConfirm=None, onClose=None)`
  
  Close the order with the given orderId if it still open.

#### `close_all_orders()`
  
  Tells the OrderManager to close all of the open orders.

#### `close_orders_multi(self, orderIds)`
  
  Takes an array of orderIds and closes them all.
