## Installation

```console
python3 -m pip install bitfinex-api-py
```

---

# Quickstart

```python
from bfxapi import Client, REST_HOST

from bfxapi.types import Notification, Order

bfx = Client(
    rest_host=REST_HOST,
    api_key="<YOUR BFX API-KEY>",
    api_secret="<YOUR BFX API-SECRET>"
)

notification: Notification[Order] = bfx.rest.auth.submit_order(
    type="EXCHANGE LIMIT", symbol="tBTCUSD", amount=0.165212, price=30264.0)

order: Order = notification.data

if notification.status == "SUCCESS":
    print(f"Successful new order for {order.symbol} at {order.price}$.")

if notification.status == "ERROR":
    raise Exception(f"Something went wrong: {notification.text}")
```

## Authenticating in your account

To authenticate in your account, you must provide a valid API-KEY and API-SECRET:
```python
bfx = Client(
    [...],
    api_key=os.getenv("BFX_API_KEY"),
    api_secret=os.getenv("BFX_API_SECRET")
)
```

### Warning

Remember to not share your API-KEYs and API-SECRETs with anyone. \
Everyone who owns one of your API-KEYs and API-SECRETs will have full access to your account. \
We suggest saving your credentials in a local `.env` file and accessing them as environment variables.

_Revoke your API-KEYs and API-SECRETs immediately if you think they might have been stolen._

> **NOTE:** A guide on how to create, edit and revoke API-KEYs and API-SECRETs can be found [here](https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003363429-How-to-create-and-revoke-a-Bitfinex-API-Key).

## Instantiating the client

```python
bfx = Client(wss_host=PUB_WSS_HOST)
```

`Client::wss` contains an instance of `BfxWebSocketClient` (core implementation of the WebSocket client). \
The `wss_host` argument is used to indicate the URL to which the WebSocket client should connect. \
The `bfxapi` package exports 2 constants to quickly set this URL:

Constant | URL | When to use
:--- | :--- | :---
WSS_HOST | wss://api.bitfinex.com/ws/2 | Suitable for all situations, supports authentication.
PUB_WSS_HOST | wss://api-pub.bitfinex.com/ws/2 | For public uses only, doesn't support authentication.

PUB_WSS_HOST is recommended over WSS_HOST for applications that don't require authentication.

> **NOTE:** The `wss_host` parameter is optional, and the default value is WSS_HOST.

### Authentication

To learn how to authenticate in your account, have a look at [Authenticating in your account](#authenticating-in-your-account).

If authentication is successful, the client will emit the `authenticated` event. \
All operations that require authentication will fail if run before the emission of this event. \
The `data` argument contains information about the authentication, such as the `userId`, the `auth_id`, etc...

```python
@bfx.wss.on("authenticated")
def on_authenticated(data: Dict[str, Any]):
    print(f"Successful login for user <{data['userId']}>.")
```

`data` can also be useful for checking if an API-KEY has certain permissions:

```python
@bfx.wss.on("authenticated")
def on_authenticated(data: Dict[str, Any]):
    if not data["caps"]["orders"]["read"]:
        raise Exception("This application requires read permissions on orders.")

    if not data["caps"]["positions"]["write"]:
        raise Exception("This application requires write permissions on positions.")
```

## Running the client

The client can be run using `BfxWebSocketClient::run`:
```python
bfx.wss.run()
```

If an event loop is already running, users can start the client with `BfxWebSocketClient::start`:
```python
await bfx.wss.start()
```

If the client succeeds in connecting to the server, it will emit the `open` event. \
This is the right place for all bootstrap activities, such as subscribing to public channels. \
To learn more about events and public channels, see [Listening to events](#listening-to-events) and [Subscribing to public channels](#subscribing-to-public-channels).

```python
@bfx.wss.on("open")
async def on_open():
    await bfx.wss.subscribe("ticker", symbol="tBTCUSD")
```

### Closing the connection

Users can close the connection with the WebSocket server using `BfxWebSocketClient::close`:
```python
await bfx.wss.close()
```

A custom [close code number](https://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xhtml#close-code-number), along with a verbose reason, can be given as parameters:
```python
await bfx.wss.close(code=1001, reason="Going Away")
```

After closing the connection, the client will emit the `disconnected` event:
```python
@bfx.wss.on("disconnected")
def on_disconnected(code: int, reason: str):
    if code == 1000 or code == 1001:
        print("Closing the connection without errors!")
```

## Subscribing to public channels

Users can subscribe to public channels using `BfxWebSocketClient::subscribe`:
```python
await bfx.wss.subscribe("ticker", symbol="tBTCUSD")
```

On each successful subscription, the client will emit the `subscribed` event:
```python
@bfx.wss.on("subscribed")
def on_subscribed(subscription: subscriptions.Subscription):
    if subscription["channel"] == "ticker":
        print(f"{subscription['symbol']}: {subscription['sub_id']}") # tBTCUSD: f2757df2-7e11-4244-9bb7-a53b7343bef8
```

### Unsubscribing from a public channel

It is possible to unsubscribe from a public channel at any time. \
Unsubscribing from a public channel prevents the client from receiving any more data from it. \
This can be done using `BfxWebSocketClient::unsubscribe`, and passing the `sub_id` of the public channel you want to unsubscribe from:

```python
await bfx.wss.unsubscribe(sub_id="f2757df2-7e11-4244-9bb7-a53b7343bef8")
```

### Setting a custom `sub_id`

The client generates a random `sub_id` for each subscription. \
These values must be unique, as the client uses them to identify subscriptions. \
However, it is possible to force this value by passing a custom `sub_id` to `BfxWebSocketClient::subscribe`:

```python
await bfx.wss.subscribe("candles", key="trade:1m:tBTCUSD", sub_id="507f1f77bcf86cd799439011")
```

## Listening to events

Whenever the WebSocket client receives data, it will emit a specific event. \
Users can either ignore those events or listen for them by registering callback functions. \
These callback functions can also be asynchronous; in fact the client fully supports coroutines ([`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)).

To add a listener for a specific event, users can use the decorator `BfxWebSocketClient::on`:
```python
@bfx.wss.on("candles_update")
def on_candles_update(sub: subscriptions.Candles, candle: Candle):
    print(f"Candle update for key <{sub['key']}>: {candle}")
```

The same can be done without using decorators:
```python
bfx.wss.on("candles_update", callback=on_candles_update)
```

# Advanced features

## Using custom notifications

**Using custom notifications requires user authentication.**

Users can send custom notifications using `BfxWebSocketClient::notify`:
```python
await bfx.wss.notify({ "foo": 1 })
```

Any data can be sent along with a custom notification.

Custom notifications are broadcast by the server on all user's open connections. \
So, each custom notification will be sent to every online client of the current user. \
Whenever a client receives a custom notification, it will emit the `notification` event:
```python
@bfx.wss.on("notification")
def on_notification(notification: Notification[Any]):
    print(notification.data) # { "foo": 1 }
```

# Examples

## Creating a new order

```python
import os

from bfxapi import Client, WSS_HOST

from bfxapi.types import Notification, Order

bfx = Client(
    wss_host=WSS_HOST,
    api_key=os.getenv("BFX_API_KEY"),
    api_secret=os.getenv("BFX_API_SECRET")
)

@bfx.wss.on("authenticated")
async def on_authenticated(_):
    await bfx.wss.inputs.submit_order(
        type="EXCHANGE LIMIT", symbol="tBTCUSD", amount=0.165212, price=30264.0)

@bfx.wss.on("order_new")
def on_order_new(order: Order):
    print(f"Successful new order for {order.symbol} at {order.price}$.")

@bfx.wss.on("on-req-notification")
def on_notification(notification: Notification[Order]):
    if notification.status == "ERROR":
        raise Exception(f"Something went wrong: {notification.text}")

bfx.wss.run()
```

## Installation and setup

A brief guide on how to install and set up the project in your Python 3.8+ environment.

### Cloning the repository

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bitfinex-api-py.git
```

### Installing the dependencies

```console
python3 -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

Make sure to install `dev-requirements.txt` (and not `requirements.txt`!). \
`dev-requirements.txt` will install all dependencies in `requirements.txt` plus any development dependency. \
dev-requirements includes [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy), [black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort), [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), and [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) (more on these tools in later chapters).

All done, your Python 3.8+ environment should now be able to run `bitfinex-api-py`'s source code.

### Set up the pre-commit hooks (optional)

**Do not skip this paragraph if you intend to contribute to the project.**

This repository includes a pre-commit configuration file that defines the following hooks:
1. [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort)
2. [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
3. [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8)

To set up pre-commit use:
```console
python3 -m pre_commit install
```

These will ensure that isort, black and flake8 are run on each git commit.

[Visit this page to learn more about git hooks and pre-commit.](https://pre-commit.com/#introduction)

#### Manually triggering the pre-commit hooks

You can also manually trigger the execution of all hooks with:
```console
python3 -m pre_commit run --all-files
```

## Before opening a PR
