# bfxapi

This module is used to interact with the bitfinex api


# bfxapi.client

This module exposes the core bitfinex clients which includes both
a websocket client and a rest interface client


## Client
```python
Client(self,
       API_KEY=None,
       API_SECRET=None,
       rest_host='https://api-pub.bitfinex.com/v2',
       ws_host='wss://api-pub.bitfinex.com/ws/2',
       create_event_emitter=None,
       logLevel='INFO',
       dead_man_switch=False,
       ws_capacity=25,
       channel_filter=[],
       *args,
       **kwargs)
```

The bfx client exposes rest and websocket objects


# BfxWebsocket
```python
BfxWebsocket(self,
             API_KEY=None,
             API_SECRET=None,
             host='wss://api-pub.bitfinex.com/ws/2',
             manageOrderBooks=False,
             dead_man_switch=False,
             ws_capacity=25,
             logLevel='INFO',
             parse_float=float,
             channel_filter=[],
             *args,
             **kwargs)
```

More complex websocket that heavily relies on the btfxwss module.
This websocket requires authentication and is capable of handling orders.
